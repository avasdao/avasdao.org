# Stakeline

Creating stakelines will generate NEW transferable NFTs from your time-locked assets.

Add these NFTs to your Account/Profile wallet to upgrade the service options available on our respective platform.

:::info

__You should know?__

Assets locked in a stakeline WILL still receive ALL airdrops reserved exclusively for stakeholders.

Stakelines are the BEST way to retain 100% control over your precious assets while unlocking additional utility.
