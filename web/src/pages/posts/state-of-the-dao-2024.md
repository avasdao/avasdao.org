_Last Updated: 2024-12-31_

Welcome to our 2nd State of the DAO annual report.


<h1 class="mt-5 text-3xl font-light text-rose-500">
    What We've Accomplished
</h1>

1. __Introducton of WiserSwap__ — First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. __Launch of Nxy Social__ — I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. __Introduction of Token Mining__ — This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!


<h1 class="mt-5 text-3xl font-light text-rose-500">
    What's Next?
</h1>

We are currently preparing for Nexa's 1st protocol upgrade, which will introduce:

<ol class="pl-10 list-decimal">
    <li>Increased VM script limits</li>
    <li>Read-only UTXOs</li>
</ol>

With the introduction of these key technologies, our team will immediately begin Version 2 deployments from our suite of NexScript contracts.
