# State Of The DAO 2024

Published on: 2024-12-01

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.


## What We've Accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!


## What's Next?

We will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
