    Our Vision (where you are)
</h1>

Reaffirming our deployed infrastructure remains our #1 priority. After witnessing the slow degradation within the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community that occurred over years, it's critical to maintain consistently peak performance.

NexaShell (https://nexa.sh) is the cornerstone of our plans to scale. Notably, Rostrum offers similar performance bottlenecks as its predecessors, namely Fulcrum (for Bitcoin Cash) and ElectrumX (for Bitcoin).


<h1 class="mt-10 text-5xl font-light text-rose-500">
    How We See The Future...

Our plans include:

    <li>Nxy Social + Token Mining</li>
