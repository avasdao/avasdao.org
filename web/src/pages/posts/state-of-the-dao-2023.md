_Last Updated: 2023-12-31_

Welcome to our very 1st State of the DAO annual report.
You will learn about ALL of the activities that our team achieved through the year.


<h1 class="mt-5 text-3xl font-light text-rose-500">
    What We've Accomplished
</h1>

1. __Formation of Ava's DAO__ — First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. __Re-launch of Causes Cash__ — I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. __Introduction of NEXA.js__: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

    What's Next?

Next year we're preparing to GO BIG!
Our plans include:

    <li>Nxy Social + Token Mining</li>
</ol>
